# Greetings ツ

My name is Mike Tyler and this is a small collection of side projects I've put together outside of my professional work. Feel free to poke around or reach out through any of the methods below. Many thanks for taking a look.

## Projects

* __[Personal site](https://github.com/kick-push-coast/personal/tree/master/personal-site)__: A collection of info about me, my professional work, and a showcase of a couple fun projects.
* __[Dot game](https://github.com/kick-push-coast/personal/tree/master/dot-game)__: A fun interactive game using only web standard technologies.
* __[Drawing board](https://github.com/kick-push-coast/personal/tree/master/drawing-board)__: A simple drawing app with support for remote collaboration and creating drawings with generative AI.
* __Wedding site__: A site for wedding guests to RSVP to my wife and I's wedding. Not a serious project, but a fun excuse to stretch the animation and graphic design muscles. No public source code because it contains some PII, but you can see an anonymized version at [miketyler.us/wedding-rsvp](https://miketyler.us/wedding-rsvp/).
